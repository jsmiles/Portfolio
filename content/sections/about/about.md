On this portofolio site you can get a preview of some projects I have worked on recently. For each, the core functionality is illustrated. I provide links to the source code for every project. Also, each is deployed live which you can check out below.

On a daily basis I am building apps using React, NextJS and Gatsby. I am learning every day and am seeking a challenge that will support me in achieving my goals.

I worked initially as an academic and then in the data realm. Some tech I worked with includes R, Python, most varieties of SQL and many other analytics platforms.
