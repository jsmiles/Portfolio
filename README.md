# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website! In this repo you can find the source code for the site. Alternatively you can visit the site itself [here](https://jtsdev.tech/). I built it using Gatsby <img src="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/Gatsby-Monogram.svg" alt="gatsby logo" width="20"/> and really enjoyed learning the framework. 

## Projects Showcased
- ML-Viz: machine learning in the browser.
- Eye In The Sky: Landsat images from NASA
- Cheese Emporium: coming soon...:alarm_clock:

## Lessons Learned
- I really enjoyed learning GraphQL. Even though it is established, I had not used it previously. I now understand far better the hype surrounding the technology. 
- I like how fast Gatsby can be. One of the tutorials really illustrated the benefits in performance especially compared to traditional approaches. I can see how Gatsby could be the right tool under certain conditions. 
- I found the developer experience a little daunting. At times the error messages were amazing, at other times they were difficult to decipher. 

## Next Steps
- I will be adding new portfolio projects to the site as they are completed. 
- I like the simple design style but I may become tempted to add a few extra layers of sparkle, time permitting. 
- I may update the domain as its a little clunky but currently that is not a priority

## Local Dev Deployment
To access the site locally then follow the steps below 
```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jsmiles/Portfolio.git

# CD into the root directory
cd Portfolio

# Install the projects dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The project should then be available to view in any browser at the following url <http://localhost/8000> or on an alternative port if specified.
